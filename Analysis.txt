Task 0:
- O(1)
- The running time is independant of input size.

Task 1:
- O(n)
- It has 2 for loops. Each one is iterating from 1 to n. So O(2n) which in turn, following Big-O notation simplified to O(n). 

Task 2:
- O(n)
- The algorithm is liner time and having 1 for loop.

Task 3:
- O(nlog(n))
- It has 3 for loops, resulting in O(3n) and 1 sorting function which is O(nlog(n)). Combining these two results in O(3n + nlogn).
  However it can be simplified to O(nlog(n)).

Task 4:
- O(nlog(n))
- It has 2 for loops, resulting in O(2n) and 1 sorting function which is O(nlog(n)). Combining these two results in O(2n + nlogn).
  However it can be simplified to O(nlog(n)).
